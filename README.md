# TicTacToe

Well here we go- This is my first real attempt at any sort of coding/development. The objective is to have a clean functioning version of Still a WIP, but have utilized HTML, CSS and JQuery to power the game. Interested in tracking & storing moves using MongoDB.

Shout out to Pauline Ghiazza, have refrenced her game on codepen quite a bit.
